Examples as Jupyter Notebooks
==================================================

Over time, we are creating a curated collection of ideas and examples
using PyTamaro.
This `GitHub repository <https://github.com/LuCEresearchlab/pytamaro-examples>`_
contains the sources of the examples as Jupyter notebooks.

You can try them out directly in your browser thanks to `Binder <https://mybinder.org/>`_.

Eager to try? Check out `this exercise about creating flags <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LuCEresearchlab/pytamaro-examples/HEAD?urlpath=doc/tree/Italian_flag.ipynb>`_!
